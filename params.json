{"name":"Lazy 2.0 (Genesis)","tagline":"","body":"Lazy 2.0 (Genesis) Readme\r\n---\r\nGenesis is a lightweight, template based MVC framework which features:\r\n\r\n* a PHP-based core. Unlike other frameworks where you, as a developer, are forced to adapt to it, Genesis takes your fundamental knowledge of PHP and adapts to you. You spend more time developing, rather than learning the framework.\r\n* a template engine based on the Pear\\HTML_Template_ITX Class, that allows total separation of HTML and PHP code.This allows PHP/MySQL and HTML/CSS/Javascript developers to work simultaneously on a single page of the site, as opposed to traditional non-template approaches.\r\n* a structured Data Controller that utilizes the PHP PDO Class, that includes auto validation based on table schema, automatic paging, and field sanitation.\r\n* a Session Class that generates a unique ID to allow multiple development sites to have individual session variables.\r\n\r\n*Genesis is free to use, distribute and share.\r\nCredits to Norbert Christian L. Feria for initiating the original prototype of this project and giving inspiration to its development.*\r\n\r\nBasic Overview\r\n---\r\n\r\n* URL-based routing\r\n* Separated HTML and PHP coding\r\n* Paired files allow for simultaenous editing of a single page or section\r\n* PHP-focused approach\r\n\r\n\r\nURL and Folder structure relationship\r\n---\r\n\r\nLoaded files will be based on the URI. Browsing to the home directory will load both `contents/default/default.htm` as the template, and `contents/default/default.php` as the backend file.\r\n\r\nInternal contents are be based on the depth of the URL and the structure of the folder, example: http://hostname.com/about/ will check if either `contents/about/default.htm` and/or `contents/about/default.php` exists, if not, it will proceed to check `contents/about.htm` and `contents/about.php` exists, and if neither check succeeds, it will load `contents/404.htm` as the display template.\r\n\r\nThe framework does not limit the number of folders in the URL, example: browsing to `http://hostname.com/universe/solarsystem/milkyway/earth/` will trigger a check for `contents/universe/solarsystem/milyway/earth/default.htm` or `contents/universe/solarsystem/milyway/earth/default.php`, then `contents/universe/solarsystem/milyway/earth.htm` or `contents/universe/solarsystem/milyway/earth.php`.\r\n\r\n*More information are provided in each respective classes.*\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I get set up?\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Download Genesis Framework files (http://for3play.github.io/lazy-2.0-genesis/)\r\n* Enable mod_rewrite module for Apache\r\n* Grab a cup of coffee and start reading throught the documentation under public/\r\n\r\n\r\n*full class documentation can be found in trello. https://trello.com/b/7bZ6BtHl/lazy-2-0-genesis\r\nyou can email me for access: for3play@gmail.com*\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
