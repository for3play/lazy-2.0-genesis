Lazy 2.0 (Genesis)
---
Genesis is a lightweight, template based MVC micro-framework which features:

* a PHP-based core. Unlike other frameworks where you, as a developer, are forced to adapt to it, Genesis takes your fundamental knowledge of PHP and adapts to you. You spend more time developing, rather than learning the framework.
* a template engine based on the Pear\HTML_Template_ITX Class, that allows total separation of HTML and PHP code.This allows PHP/MySQL and HTML/CSS/Javascript developers to work simultaneously on a single page of the site, as opposed to traditional non-template approaches.
* a structured Data Controller that utilizes the PHP PDO Class, that includes auto validation based on table schema, automatic paging, and field sanitation.
* a Session Class that generates a unique ID to allow multiple development sites to have individual session variables.
